            Helping you unlock your most valuable, yet underutilized, resource.
            
            Having spent the past four years uncovering private company insights buried within public data, I'm adept at planning, developing, and executing large scale data systems, particularly those focusd on OSINT.
            I've helped Private Equity firms source deals, Fortune 100 sales teams source leads, and every type of company build sophisticated competitor tracking systems.
